# Font Wont
_View webpages in your wonted font (DP Sans Mono)._

**Why?**
<br>
I got sick of doing "inspect element" and changing body fonts to <span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS,cursive">Comic Sans MS</span>.

_**Why???**_
<br>
It's more readable than monotone fonts. (Serif fonts on a screen, my beloathed.)

**OK... how do I use it?**
1. Download the repo.
2. Open up Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory to which you downloaded the repo.

**Wow, this font is pretty cool! What is it?**
<br>
It's [DP Sans Mono](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Sans_Mono), a font developed by the Project Gutenberg Distributed Proofreaders. It's designed to make proofreading easier, so I thought it might make regular reading easier too.
